                <p>Goku Black (ゴクウブラック Gokū Burakku), usually referred to as Black, is the main antagonist of the "Future" Trunks Saga of Dragon Ball Super. His true identity is the original present Zamasu (ザマス Zamasu), a former North Kai and Supreme Kai apprentice serving the Supreme Kai of Universe 10, Gowasu, from the unaltered main timeline, in which he stole the body of the original present Goku with the Super Dragon Balls and sought to destroy all mortals alongside Future Zamasu.[3] He was then given the name "Goku Black" by Future Bulma when he initially referred to himself as Goku</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>His original appearance is the same as his future timeline counterpart, being an above-average height Kai of slim built and green skin, and with a white Mohawk. However, after killing the original present Gowasu, he wore his former master's matching set of green with gold chains Potara earrings. After stealing the original present Goku's body, it underwent some physical changes. While still essentially identical, he has a slightly darker skin tone and more "defined" eyes, along with a somewhat skinnier physique. His hair is also a noticeably dark shade of black with only four front spikes and three back ones. While initially wearing his Supreme Kai attire, he soon after taking Goku's body began wearing a dark grey vest, a long-sleeved black undershirt with a turtleneck, a red sash, black pants and pointy white boots. He also gave the right Potara earring to his future counterpart while still wearing the other earring on his left ear. In the anime, he also wears a Time Ring on his right index finger, while in the manga, his counterpart is trusted with wearing it. Also, in the manga, he has dark outlines around his eyes.</p>
